**Elite Dangerous hides signals in its audio. This listens for them while you fly.**

There is something in the black that transmits. The
[Landscape Signal](https://canonn.science/codex/cartographics/the-landscape-signal/)
is a picture drawn in sound — mountains, a horizon, a repeating pattern — audible
from anywhere in the galaxy, discovered by commanders who happened to look at a
spectrogram. Nobody knows how many others there are.

ED Compass watches for them so you don't have to. Three lamps in your cockpit,
lit when something is out there.

flying you'd normally use the cockpit overlay instead.</sub>

## Install

**[⬇ Download the latest release](../../releases)** — run
`ED-Compass-Setup-x.x.x.exe` and you're done. No administrator rights, nothing else to
install.

Windows will say *"unknown publisher"*. Click **More info → Run anyway**. That
warning appears for every small free tool that hasn't paid for a signing
certificate.

Then start Elite. The overlay appears by itself whenever the game is in front of
you, and gets out of the way when it isn't.

Two settings in Elite are worth changing:

> **Graphics → Display Mode: Borderless.** Not exclusive fullscreen — no overlay
> of any kind can draw over it.
>
> **Audio → Music: 0.** ED Compass listens to everything your speakers play, and
> the soundtrack is loud, broadband and full of exactly the sustained tones and
> drifting notes a real signal looks like. Turning it off is the single biggest
> thing you can do for detection quality. Ship and effects audio can stay on.

It hears your whole sound output, not just the game — so anything else playing
lands in the recording alongside the signal. Worth silencing before a serious
listen: **Discord or any voice chat**, **music players and Spotify**, **video in
a browser tab**, and **Windows notification sounds**. A voice on Discord looks
much like a transmission to a detector, and a paused video that resumes itself
will sit in the middle of your capture.

## What you'll see

Three lamps, reading upward as a ladder. Each rung is stronger evidence than the
one below it, and they light together — so what matters is **how far up it
goes**, not which one is lit.

| | |
|---|---|
| **SIGNAL** | The strongest claim. Either something it can name — the Landscape Signal by its period, or a keyed transmission such as Thargoid Sensor Morse — or a stroke it has traced across the spectrogram. The line beneath says which. |
| **CYPHER** | Something carries deliberate structure: tones keyed on and off, or a shape drawn into the spectrogram. |
| **ANOMALY** | Something departed from the background. The quietest rung, and the most often lit — ordinary ship noise sets it off regularly, which is why it is coloured to be ignorable. |

Beside them, a live spectrogram of what the game is playing, marked up as it
goes:

* **Outlines** around anything it found — yellow where something crossed a
  threshold, cyan around a stroke it followed across the picture.
* **A strip along the bottom** showing when things happened, on the same
  left-to-right timeline as the spectrogram above it. A lamp tells you about now;
  the strip tells you about the last couple of minutes, so a detection that fired
  while you were watching the instruments is still there when you look up.

When something fires, the audio is saved automatically, tagged with the star
system and coordinates you were at.

**ANOMALY on its own means very little.** Ordinary ship noise departs from the
background constantly, which is why that rung is the quietest colour on the
panel. It is worth glancing at when the ladder climbs above it.

**The drawn-structure detector is not yet dependable.** It cannot reliably tell a
real signal apart from ship noise, so do not read anything into it either way.

The period reading under SIGNAL is the one to act on. It is the measurement that
has been checked against a real recording of a known signal.

## Is this allowed?

Yes. It listens to sound your speakers are already playing and reads the journal
files the game writes for exactly this purpose — the same things EDDiscovery,
EDMC and every other companion tool use. It never touches the game process, its
memory, or its files, and it gives you no advantage over any other commander. It
only notices things you could have noticed yourself with headphones and patience.

## Does it actually work?

Partly, and it is worth knowing which parts.

Given the community's published recording of the Landscape Signal, ED Compass
recovers its period from the audio alone — no template, nothing to match
against — and agrees with the figure Canonn documented. Keyed transmissions are
detected the same way.

Flying with it is harder than analysing a clean recording. Pointed at a real
signal in the black it will draw around what it finds and light SIGNAL, but it
will not always name what it has found, and its drawn-structure detection is not
yet dependable. This is why it is an alpha.

It costs a fraction of one CPU core and about 40 MB, so you can leave it
running.

## Finding something

If you catch a signal nobody has catalogued, that's a find worth sharing.

1. Note the system and where you were pointing.
2. Press **Export**. It saves the audio and the spectrogram image together.
3. Take it to the [Canonn Research Group](https://canonn.science/) — they are the
   people who found the Landscape Signal in the first place.

Every detection keeps a small JSON record with the system, coordinates, scores
and period — kept forever, even after the audio itself is cleaned up, so your
observations accumulate into something you can triangulate from.

## Questions

**Will it fill my disk?** No. Recordings are FLAC and capped (about 2 GB by
default, roughly 350 captures). When it's full the **oldest** automatic
recordings are removed first, and **anything you kept yourself with Export goes
last of all**. The written record of every observation survives regardless, even
after its audio is gone. There's a usage bar in the control panel, and an **erase
all** button for when you want the whole folder back at once — that one takes
your Export-kept recordings too.

**Do I need 7.1 surround?** No. Direction finding is an optional extra that needs
it; detection works fine in stereo, which is what almost everyone should use.

**Does it make any sound?** No, deliberately — an audio alert would be picked up
by its own microphone-equivalent and detected as a signal.

**Can I just unzip it?** Yes, there's a portable zip on the releases page.
Settings and recordings stay in that folder.
