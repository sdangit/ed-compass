//! The analysis engine: interleaved audio in, snapshots and detections out.
//!
//! This is the whole chain in one place — ring, per-channel STFT, novelty
//! detection, direction finding, and the two spectrogram tiers — deliberately
//! free of any Windows or UI dependency so it can be driven equally well by
//! WASAPI, by a synthetic source, or by a WAV file.
//!
//! It owns no threads. The caller decides when to push audio and when to take a
//! snapshot, which keeps the real-time capture path and the display rate
//! genuinely independent.
